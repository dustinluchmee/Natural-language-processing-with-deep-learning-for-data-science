## Extracting tweet-like summaries from the news
### Techniques employed:
- Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)
- Scikit-learn
- Text and data mining (TDM)
- Inverse document frequency (IDF)
- Logistic regression
- ROUGE-L
- Matplotlib
### Summary: <br/>
News stories can be further condensed into ‘tweet’ like summaries. By operating a statistical
engine, isolating the inverse document frequencies, creating a logistic classifier, and evaluating the
precision, accuracy, and recall metrics of our summarizations. Box-and-whisker plotting was done to
visualize these metrics.
